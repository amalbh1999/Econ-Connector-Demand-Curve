# Econ-Connector-Demand-Curve
Data 88 is Berkeley's first and only course that studies the intersection between data science and economics using real-world data and Python. The link to the course can be found at https://d8a-88.github.io/econ-fa19/. I created course material for two weeks: (1) Demand Curve and Market Equilibrium, and (2) Measures of Inequality, Tax Rates

Demand Curve and Market Equilibrium: I created the lab and homework for Demand Curve and Market Equilibrium. Students learned how to find the demand curve and market equilibrium using Airline data using data cleaning and data visualization techniques. My contribution to the online textbook can be found at https://d8a-88.github.io/econ-models-textbook/econ-fa19/wk03/lab03.html. 

Measures of Inequality, Tax Rates: Coming Soon

Python Libraries used: NumPy, Pandas, SymPy, matplotlib, datascience
