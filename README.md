# Econ-Connector-Demand-Curve
Data 88 is Berkeley's first and only course that studies the intersection between data science and economics using real-world data and Python. I created the material for Week 3's lab and homework. Students learned how to find the demand curve and market equilibrium using airline data using data cleaning and data visualization techniques.
